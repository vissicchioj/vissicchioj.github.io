                        Throughout the summer of 2022, I was an Information Technology Intern at Fox Corp. This was my first true taste of what
                        it is like working a technical job in the real world. I would wake up early every weekday and and make my commute to 
                        New York City to start my work day by 9am. I spent most of my time occupying the help desk with two other employees
                        that also acted as my mentors. They were incredibly influential and they really helped me grow fast in order to understand
                        what needs to be done everyday. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The most common responsibility was reimaging corporate-owned laptops in order to be available
                        for employee use when needed. This was done tons of times everyday because of how many employees worked for Fox Corp.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another responsibility was technical support for employees. Employees often visited the help desk regarding an issue
                        with their machine or perhaps their input/output devices. I was in charge of assessing the issue and quickly devising
                        a solution in order to meet their needs. The most common issue we noticed were actually printer problems because
                        they had a cloud-based software to handle printing which was pretty complicated for those that did not understand it.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        I was also in charge of emailing remote working employees in order to schedule meetings to address technical issues
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What was really fun was that I eventually got so used to common occurences working there that I was actually able to
                        help a new employee that came in halfway through my internship.
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        This internship was an incredible experience and I recommend others to try it if they are ever given the chance.
